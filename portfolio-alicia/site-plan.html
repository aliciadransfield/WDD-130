        Hi, I’m Alicia Dransfield - an artist and designer with a passion for creativity. I earned my associates degree in Liberal Arts in 2024, and I’m currently pursuing a bachelors in Graphic Design with an emphasis in UX UI. Art and design have always been a part of who I am, and I love experimenting with different mediums to capture the beauty of life - the highs, lows, and everything in between. Each medium showcases life in different ways, with unique perspectives that I find fascinating.  Much of my work is inspired by the everyday - the quiet, overlooked moments that are just a snapshot in time, and the beautiful world we live in. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond art, I’m always learning and exploring new ways to create. I love music, reading, and cooking and baking experiments in the kitchen. I love gardening and the sense of calm and connection it gives me to nature. I also love playing games - video games, board games, card games - allowing me to connect and be with my friends and family. I also have a growing interest in coding and web development, with the blend of logic and creativity that it requires. And when the weather is just right, there is nothing better than simply being outside and enjoying that moment in time.

      <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
      <p>These are some of my graphic design projects, ranging from personal explorations, and experiments to commissioned work. I enjoy pushing the boundaries of my designs and finding new ways to visually communicate. Most of my work focuses on clear and impactful storytelling, particularly in poster design, where effectively communicating is key.
        I primarily work with Adobe products such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. Throughout the design process, I constantly consider the message I want to convey and explore different techniques to make a compelling and accessible design. Whether through refining typography, experimenting with composition, or playing with color and texture, I’m always looking for new ways to create designs that resonate and connect.

      <h3>Drawing</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        These are some of my drawings and illustrations, ranging from quick sketches and studies to fully realized pieces.  My sketches, often done in pencil or pen, focus more on human features, expression, and elements of nature, allowing me to capture the raw details in an exploitative way.  When it comes to full on illustrations, I primarily use digital tools, charcoal, or colored media to create expressive snapshots in time. My work often explores the connections of life, highlighting emotions and occasionally stories. Whether done through linework or atmospheric compositions I always aim for a sense of presence in each piece.

      <h3>Painting</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        These are some of the paintings that I have done. My paintings are passion projects, each reflecting my love for nature and the subtle beauty found in everyday life. I have two main mediums for my paintings; acrylic and watercolor, using each medium to explore different aspects of color, form, and emotion. With acrylics, I make bolder compositions and explore using strong vibrant colors to create a contrast. With my watercolors pieces I focus on the delicacy and softness of nature, capturing the quieter hues of life. Across all of my paintings I aim to highlight the beauty of the world we have using a variety of styles. I am continually experimenting with new concepts and techniques to bring each vision to life.

      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        These are some of my photographs. My photography focuses on capturing the unfiltered beauty of the natural world around us. I find endless inspiration in nature - whether on hikes, while traveling, or just enjoying everyday moments. From vast landscapes to the intricate details of plants and changing light, I aim to create strong compositions that highlight the natural world’s elegance.
        Beyond nature, I also enjoy exploring the interaction of organic and man-made to create beauty. Being able to find the harmony between architecture and the environment. Through my lens, I strive to document the quiet, often overlooked beauties of life in the modern world.

      <h3>Book arts</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        These are some of the books that I have made. This semester, I began exploring bookmarking and artist books, and it has been amazing to learn about. I have gained a deep appreciation for the intricacy of book design, from the aesthetics to the structural techniques that bring each piece together. Learning about different binding styles and their historical and functional significance has been fascinating. Each method offers a unique way to connect the pages and cover, and tell a story - not just through words, but through the craftsmanship and thought that goes into a book. Learning about bookmaking has given me a new creative avenue and is another thing to explore and push the boundaries of my creativity.       </p>
