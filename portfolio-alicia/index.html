                <p>Hi, I’m Alicia Dransfield - an artist and designer with a passion for creativity. I earned my associates degree in Liberal Arts in 2024, and I’m currently pursuing a bachelors in Graphic Design with an emphasis in UX UI. Art and design have always been a part of who I am, and I love experimenting with different mediums to capture the beauty of life - the highs, lows, and everything in between. Each medium showcases life in different ways, with unique perspectives that I find fascinating.  Much of my work is inspired by the everyday - the quiet, overlooked moments that are just a snapshot in time, and the beautiful world we live in. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond art, I’m always learning and exploring new ways to create. I love music, reading, and cooking and baking experiments in the kitchen. I love gardening and the sense of calm and connection it gives me to nature. I also love playing games - video games, board games, card games - allowing me to connect and be with my friends and family. I also have a growing interest in coding and web development, with the blend of logic and creativity that it requires. And when the weather is just right, there is nothing better than simply being outside and enjoying that moment in time.
