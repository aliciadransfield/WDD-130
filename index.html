        <p>I am a graphic design major with an emphasis in UX/UI. I'm hoping to work in video games. I have lots of different hobbies. I like doing almost all forms of art, crochet, drawing, painting, music, video games, and cooking/baking. I'm taking this course because I do like learning about how different people use different platforms and the thought process behind it. There is also a good chance that I will be doing some work in web design in the future. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my whole life. </p>
